    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I am a RIBA Part 1 architecture graduate from the University of Dundee, passionate about creating sustainable, accessible and attractive spaces. 


I’m drawn to architecture that responds to its context and leaves a positive impact on the people who use it. I enjoy thinking about what makes a place work and how design choices can subtly improve everyday life. My attention to detail, ability to think creatively and practically help me come up with unique ideas and fine-tune them into real, thoughtful solutions. I’m looking for an opportunity to develop and learn within a team that values purposeful, well-crafted design..</p>
